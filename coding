Certifications
freeCodeCamp.org offers several free developer certifications. Each of these certifications involves building 5 required web app projects, along with hundreds of optional coding challenges to help you prepare for those projects. We estimate that each certification will take a beginner programmer around 300 hours to earn.

Each of these 50 projects in the freeCodeCamp.org curriculum has its own agile user stories and automated tests. These help you build up your project incrementally and ensure you've fulfilled all the user stories before you submit it.

You can pull in these test suites through freeCodeCamp's CDN. This means you can build these projects on websites like CodePen and Replit - or even on your local computer's development environment.

Once you've earned a certification, you will always have it. You will always be able to link to it from your LinkedIn or resume. And when your prospective employers or freelance clients click that link, they'll see a verified certification specific to you.

The one exception to this is if we discover violations of our Academic Honesty Policy. When we catch people unambiguously plagiarizing (submitting other people's code or projects as their own without citation), we do what all rigorous institutions of learning should do - we revoke their certifications and ban those people.
